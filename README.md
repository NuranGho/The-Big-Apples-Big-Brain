Motivation: Education is a very vital part of our childhoods and helps shape us into who we are, not only as academics, but as people. With the subject of education, often comes the subject of tutoring. We each have primary sources of information when it comes to this topic. Some of us have siblings enrolled as DOE students, and some have friends who are teachers in the DOE. We see and hear about the performance levels of today’s students and just how important tutoring is, especially at that age. Some of us also have our own experiences with tutoring when we were kids, and looking back, we can see how well that paid off. So we wanted to take a closer look at how kids are testing, the levels they’re testing at, and how they could benefit from tutoring.

Additional Info: The cleaned data was pushed into our Google BigQuery Data Warehouse, where we ran queries to answer our KPIs, then connected it to Tableau to visualize.
